    <h2>Bradley Hunter</h2>
    <p>I am the third kid of four in my family. I am from Ridefield, Washington
        which is just north of Vancouver, Washington and it feels like it rains
        atleast once a week no matter the time of year.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing a degree in software engineering. The thing that I like best
         about BYU-Idaho is the size of classes.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
        for my enter life. My favorite religious quote is from Bradley R. Wilcox
        which says: "God's message is that worthiness is not flawlessness.
        Worthiness is being trying and honest."</p>
